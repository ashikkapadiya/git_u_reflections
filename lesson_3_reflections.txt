When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-To make a repository open for anyone to contribute in it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Before pulling a brach to a local repository we need to check the commits to 
verify its truth vesion after anyone else commiting the repository to avoid errors.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
-Fork is used when we want to change any repository with many contributors. It copies content
to git rather than local machine.
-Clone is used when we want to copy content to the local machine.
-Branches are used when there are many purposes to modify code for experiments or 
bug improvements. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
-To track the changes for remote commits that are yet unknown to local machine.
